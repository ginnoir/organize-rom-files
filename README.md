# organize_game_files.sh

This Bash script organizes disc-based video game ROMs into structured folders with optional playlist (`.m3u`/`.m3u8`) generation, metadata files, cue path rewriting, and more. It supports CHD, BIN/CUE, CCD/IMG/SUB, and ISO formats, and intelligently groups multi-disc games while optionally including single-disc and cartridge-based ROMs.

## Features

- Detect and group multi-disc games
- Optional support for single-disc and cartridge-based games
- Generate `.m3u` or `.m3u8` playlists
- Normalize region and disc naming
- Rewrites `.cue` file `FILE` paths
- Optional playlist and disc organization into per-game folders
- Create `gamelist.xml` for EmulationStation and `.lpl` for RetroArch
- Detect duplicate single-disc variants (e.g., v1.0 and v1.1) and skip playlist creation
- Dry-run mode with preview of actions
- Auto-disc number sorting in playlists
- Logging support with `--log-output`

## Supported Formats

- `.chd`
- `.cue` (with `.bin`, `.wav`, `.mp3`, etc.)
- `.ccd` (with `.img`, `.sub`)
- `.iso`
